Thank you for checking my challenge solution🌝🌝

It was a little bit challengling for me.

What I learned :

1. How to create a side bar.
2. How to work with grid in tailwindcss
3. How work with the picture tag

Difficulties I faced:

1. After completing this challenge as I went to build it using vite build my background images weren't showing up. At the end I omited the build (dist folder ) and uploaded it.
